 Docker Registry

The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images.

## Setting up the Docker Registry

>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2

This pulls the registry:2 image from the docker hub and runs the docker container. The name of the container is Registry.

>docker pull ubuntu && docker tag ubuntu localhost:5000/myfirstimage

This pulls the ubuntu image from the docker hub. And we tag the image to localhost:5000/myfirstimage

>docker push localhost:5000/myfirstimage

When we try to push the image, it locally saves in the host file system. This we call as the __Docker Registry__

To stop the Registry we use

>docker stop registry

To remove Registry with all the data
>docker rm -v registry

## Docker Private Registry.

Docker Private Registry is to deploy the docker images present in one VM or host to another VM or Host.

Create a file system like given below in the host computer
```
.
├── Docker
│   └── Vagrantfile
└── Docker-Client
    └── Vagrantfile
```

Both vagrant file of the same Docker Box file.

Change the ip in the both the Vagrentfile as "192.168.33.10" and "192.168.33.11"

Now bring up the VM in the Docker directory.

We need to install Docker Compose first.

>yum install python-pip


pip install docker-compose


### Setting Docker Registry

After isntalling Docker Compose, its time to setup the .yml file for the Docker Compose.
Since we need a place to store the list of users who can access our Registry we need a place to store it. So we are going to install httpd-tools which contains the package called as __htpasswd__

>yum install httpd-tools


mkdir ~/docker-registry && cd $_


mkdir data

In the docker-registry, we create the .yml file for compose.


>vim docker-compose.yml

Now add the following contents contents
```
registry:
  image: registry:2
  ports:
    - 127.0.0.1:5000:5000
  environment:
    REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY: /data
  volumes:
    - ./data:/data
```


    Now save the file. And run docker compose.

>docker-compose up

### Setting Nginx container

    Edit docker compose file so that we can add the configurations for Nginx.
>vim docker-compose.yml

Add the contents
```
nginx:
  image: "nginx:1.9"
  ports:
    - 5043:443
  links:
    - registry:registry
  volumes:
    - ./nginx/:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro
```

The full docker-compose.yml looks like

```
nginx:
  image: "nginx:1.9"
  ports:
    - 5043:443
  links:
    - registry:registry
  volumes:
    - ./nginx/:/etc/nginx/conf.d
registry:
  image: registry:2
  ports:
    - 127.0.0.1:5000:5000
  environment:
    REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY: /data
  volumes:
    - ./data:/data
  ```

Now we going to  edit the registry configuarations for the SSL certification

>vim ~/docker-registry/nginx/registry.conf

Add the following contents
```
  upstream docker-registry {
  server registry:5000;
}

server {
  listen 443;
  server_name myregistrydomain.com;

  # SSL
  # ssl on;
  # ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/conf.d/domain.crt;
  # ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/conf.d/domain.key;

  # disable any limits to avoid HTTP 413 for large image uploads
  client_max_body_size 0;

  # required to avoid HTTP 411: see Issue #1486 (https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/1486)
  chunked_transfer_encoding on;

  location /v2/ {
    # Do not allow connections from docker 1.5 and earlier
    # docker pre-1.6.0 did not properly set the user agent on ping, catch "Go *" user agents
    if ($http_user_agent ~ "^(docker\/1\.(3|4|5(?!\.[0-9]-dev))|Go ).*$" ) {
      return 404;
    }

    # To add basic authentication to v2 use auth_basic setting plus add_header
    # auth_basic "registry.localhost";
    # auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/registry.password;
    # add_header 'Docker-Distribution-Api-Version' 'registry/2.0' always;

    proxy_pass                          http://docker-registry;
    proxy_set_header  Host              $http_host;   # required for docker client's sake
    proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP         $remote_addr; # pass on real client's IP
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_read_timeout                  900;
  }
}
```

Save the file and exit

Now again start the docker compose.

>docker-compose up

To check whether Docker Rregistry is working or not try the following command

>curl http://localhost:5000/v2/

The output will be {}

And also try
>curl http://localhost:5043/v2/
The output will be {}

Next we going to create user and  their password who can login and access our Docker Registry
>cd ~/docker-registry/nginx

htpasswd -c registry.password USERNAME

For the first time when we run the command we use the option -c so that it creates the file. After that we dont need to use that option when we create Username

Now in the registry.conf which we created we are going to make some changes


>vim ~/docker-registry/nginx/registry.conf

Delete the below lines and
```
# To add basic authentication to v2 use auth_basic setting plus add_header
# auth_basic "registry.localhost";
# auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/registry.password;
# add_header 'Docker-Distribution-Api-Version' 'registry/2.0' always;
```

And add the following lines
```
# To add basic authentication to v2 use auth_basic setting plus add_header
auth_basic "registry.localhost";
auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/registry.password;
add_header 'Docker-Distribution-Api-Version' 'registry/2.0' always;
```

Now we are going to start the Docker Compose to see the changes  that we have done in the configuration file.
>cd ~/docker-registry

docker-compose up

Now check the in the command line
>curl http://localhost:5043/v2/

Output will be
```
<html>
<head><title>401 Authorization Required</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>401 Authorization Required</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.9.7</center>
</body>
</html>
```

This is because we we have given the registry.password file for the authentication.

Now try the below command to check
>curl http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost:5043/v2/


### Setitng the ssl certificates

For SSL certificate go to the registry.conf files and do the following changes


>nano ~/docker-registry/nginx/registry.conf

Delete the following lines of code
```
server {
listen 443;
server_name myregistrydomain.com;
# SSL
# ssl on;
# ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/conf.d/domain.crt;
# ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/conf.d/domain.key;
```

And add these lines

```
# SSL
ssl on;
ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/conf.d/domain.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/conf.d/domain.key;
```

Save and exit the file.

### Creating and Signing the Certificates

Now we are going to create and sign the SSL certificate.

>cd ~/docker-registry/nginx

 Generating the root key:
openssl genrsa -out devdockerCA.key 2048

Generating the root certificate(Press Enter whenever it prompts):
penssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key devdockerCA.key -days 10000 -out devdockerCA.crt

Generating the key for the server:
openssl genrsa -out domain.key 2048

Now we are going to send a certificate signing request.

Press Enter whenever it prompts and when it asks for the "_Common Name_" type the ip of the machine or the server address (Which you have given in registry.conf near server_name)

__Donate create a challenging password__
>openssl req -new -key domain.key -out dev-docker-registry.com.csr

Now we are going to sign the certificates request


>openssl x509 -req -in dev-docker-registry.com.csr -CA devdockerCA.crt -CAkey devdockerCA.key -CAcreateserial -out domain.crt -days 10000


Since the certificates are signed by ourself not by the Certificate Authority we have to tell the docker client that we have the authorized certificates. NOow we are going to do that locally
>update-ca-trust force-enable

cp domain.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/

update-ca-trust extract

Restart the docker service and run the docker compose file.

>sudo service docker restart

cd ~/docker-registry

docker-compose up

To check the output:
>curl https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@[YOUR-DOMAIN]:5043/v2/

Changing the ports of the Nginx from 5043 to 443 in docker-compose.yml

Change it from
```
    - 5043:443
```
to
```
    - 443:443
```
Save and exit
Run the compose file

>docker-compose up

To check the output:
>curl https://<YOURUSERNAME>:<YOURPASSWORD>@YOUR-DOMAIN/v2/

###Accessing Your Docker Registry from a Client Machine

Now we have to copy the devdockerCA file from the Registry VM to the Client VM so that we can access the Docker Registry.


>sudo cat /docker-registry/nginx/devdockerCA.crt


Copy the above data in the file,

#####ON CLIENT MACHINE:

Paste the data present in the devdockerCA.crt in the below file
>vim /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/debdockerCA.crt

Now update the certificates and restart the docker service
>update-ca-trust extract

service docker restart

Now we can access the Docker Registry that is present in the Other VM by

>docker login https://YOUR-DOMAIN

Username: USERNAME

Password: PASSWORD


After entering the correct username and their passowrd we must get the following output
>"Login Succeeded"

Now lets just pull and run ubuntu images. Do some changes in it and try pusing it to the docker registry.


>docker run -t -i ubuntu /bin/bash

touch initcron

exit

docker commit $(docker ps -lq) test-image

Now lets login to the registry and push the changes that we made in the ubuntu container.
>docker login https://YOUR-DOMAIN

Username: USERNAME

Password: PASSWORD

docker tag test-image [YOUR-DOMAIN]/test-image

docker push [YOUR-DOMAIN]/test-image


Output will be like
```
latest: digest: sha256:5ea1cfb425544011a3198757f9c6b283fa209a928caabe56063f85f3402363b4 size: 8008
```

Now check it we can go back to the server and follow the steps
>docker pull [YOUR-DOMAIN]/test-images

docker run -t -i [YOUR-DOMAIN]/test-images /bin/bash

ls

Now here we can see that the file which we created "initcron" is available.
The Docker Private Registry is successfully configured.
