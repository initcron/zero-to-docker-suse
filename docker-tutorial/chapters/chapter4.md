# Getting Started with Docker  
In this chapter, we are going to learn about docker shell, the command line utility and how to use it to
launch containers. We will also learn what it means to run a container, its lifecycle and perform basic
operations such as creating, starting, stopping, removing, pausing containers and checking the status etc.

## Using docker cli  
We can use docker cli to interact with docker daemon. Various functions of docker command is given below. Try this yourself by runnig **$sudo docker** command

```
docker
```

[Output]  
```

## Getting Information about Docker Setup  
We can get the information about our Docker setup in several ways. Namely,

```
docker -v  

docker version  

docker info  
```

[Output of **docker -v**]  
```
Docker version 1.12.1, build 23cf638
```

The **docker info** command gives a lot of useful information like total number of containers and images along with information about host resource utilization

## Launching our first container  
Now we have a basic understanding of docker command and sub commands, let us dive straight into launching our very first **container**

```
docker run alpine uptime
```

Where,

  * we are using docker **client** to
  * run a application/command **uptime** using
  * an image by name **alpine**

[Output]  
```
docker run alpine uptime
Unable to find image 'alpine:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/alpine
117f30b7ae3d: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:02eb5cfe4b721495135728ab4aea87418fd4edbfbf83612130a81191f0b2aae3
Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
 07:45:40 up  3:13,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
```

**What happened?**  
This command will

  * Pull the **alpine** image file from **docker hub**, a cloud registry
  * Create a runtime environment/ container with the above image   
  * Launch a program (called **uptime**) inside that container  
  * Stream that output to the terminal  
  * Stop the container once the program is exited

**Where did my container go?**

The point here to remember is that, when that executable stops running inside the container, the container itself will stop  
This process will further be explained under the **lifecycle of a container** topic.

Let's see what happens when we run that command again,

[Output]  
```
docker run alpine uptime
 07:48:06 up  3:15,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
```

Now docker no longer pulls the image again from registry, because **it has stored the image locally** from the previous run  
So once an image is pulled, we can make use of that image to create and run as many container as we want without the need of downloading the image again. However it has created a new instance of the image/container.

## Checking Status of the containers  
We have understood how docker run commands works. But what if you want to see list of running containers and history of containers that had run and exited? This can be done by executing the following commands

```
docker ps
```

[Output]  
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

This command doesn't give us any information. Because, **docker ps** command will only show list of container(s) which are **running**

```
docker ps -l
```

[Output]  
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES
988f4d90d604        alpine              "uptime"            About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       fervent_hypatia
```

The **-l** flag shows the last run container along with other details like image it used, command it executed, return code of that command, etc.,

```
docker ps -n 2
```

[Output]  
```
NAMES
988f4d90d604        alpine              "uptime"            About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       fervent_hypatia
acea3023dca4        alpine              "uptime"            3 minutes ago        Exited (0) 3 minutes ago                            mad_darwin
```

Docker gives us the flexibility to show the desirable number of last run containers. This can be achieved by using **-n #no_of_results** flag

```
docker ps -a
```

[Output]  
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS                  NAMES
988f4d90d604        alpine                       "uptime"                 About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                          fervent_hypatia
acea3023dca4        alpine                       "uptime"                 4 minutes ago        Exited (0) 4 minutes ago                               mad_darwin

```

This command will show all the container we have run so far.

## Running Containers in Interactive Mode  
We can interact with docker containers by giving -it flags at the run time. These flags stand for

  * i - Interactive  
  * t - tty

```
docker run -it alpine:3.4 sh
```

[Output]  
```
Unable to find image 'alpine:3.4' locally
3.4: Pulling from library/alpine

e110a4a17941: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:3dcdb92d7432d56604d4545cbd324b14e647b313626d99b889d0626de158f73a
Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:3.4
/ #
```

As you see, we have landed straight into **sh** shell of that container. This is the result of using **-it** flags and mentioning that container to run the **sh** shell. Don't try to exit that container yet. We have to execute some other commands in it to understand the next topic

## Namespaced  
Like a full fledged OS, Docker container has its own namespaces  
This enables Docker container to isolate itself from the host as well as other containers  
Run the following commands and see that alpine container has its own namespaces and not inheriting much from **host OS**

[Command]  
```
cat /etc/issue
```

[Output]  
```
Welcome to Alpine Linux 3.4

```

[Command]  
```
ps aux

[Output]  
```

```

[Command]  
```

```

[Output]  
```

```

## Shared:  
We have understood that containers have their own namespaces. But will they share something to some extent? the answer is **YES**. Let's run the following commands on both the container and the host machine

[Command]  
```
uname -a
```

[Output - **container**]  
```
Linux ae84d253ecb5 3.10.0-327.28.3.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Aug 18 19:05:49 UTC 2016 x86_64 Linux
```

[Output - **hostmachine**]  
```
Linux dockerserver 3.10.0-327.28.3.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Aug 18 19:05:49 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

As you can see, the container uses the same Linux Kernel from the host machine. Just like **uname** command, the following commands share the same information as well. In order to avoid repetition, we will see the output of container alone.

[Command]  
```

```

Now exit out of that container by running **exit** or by pressing **ctrl+d**

## Making Containers Persist

### Running Containers in Detached Mode  
So far, we have run the containers interactively. But this is not always the case. Sometimes you may want to start a container  without interacting with it. This can be achieved by using **"detached mode"** (**-d**) flag. Hence the container will launch the default application inside and run in the background. This saves a lot of time, we don't have to wait till the applications launches successfully. It will happen behind the screen. Let us run the following command to see this in action

[Command]  
```
docker run -d schoolofdevops/loop program
```

-d , --detach : detached mode

[Output]  
```
2533adf280ac4838b446e4ee1151f52793e6ac499d2e631b2c752459bb18ad5f
```

This will run the container in detached mode. We are only given with full container id as the output

Let us check whether this container is running or not

[Command]  
```
docker ps
```

[Output]  
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
2533adf280ac        schoolofdevops/loop   "program"           37 seconds ago      Up 36 seconds                           prickly_bose
```

As we can see in the output, the container is running in the background

## Connecting to running container to execute commands  
We can connect to the containers which are running in detached mode by using these following commands

[Command]  
```
docker exec -it 2533adf280ac sh
```

[Output]  
```
/ #
```

Now exit the container.

## Pausing Running Container  
Just like in a video, it is easy to pause and unpause the running container

[Command]  
```
docker pause 2533adf280ac
```

After running pause command, run docker ps again to check the container status

[Output]  
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                  PORTS               NAMES
2533adf280ac        schoolofdevops/loop   "program"           2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes (Paused)                       prickly_bose
```

## Unpausing the paused container  
This can be achieved by executing following command

[Command]  
```
docker unpause
```

Run *docker ps* to verify the changes

[Output]  
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
2533adf280ac        schoolofdevops/loop   "program"           6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes                            prickly_bose
```

## Creating and Starting a Container instead of Running  
Docker **run** command will create a container and start that container simultaneously. However Docker gives you the granularity to create a container and not to run it at the time of creation. However, This container can be started by using **start** command

[Command]  
```
docker create alpine:3.4 sh
```

Run **docker ps -l** to see the status of the container

[Output]  
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
22146d15eb71        alpine:3.4          "sh"                31 seconds ago      Created                                 grave_leavitt
```

If you do **docker ps -l**, you will find that container status to be **Created**. Now lets start this container by executing,

[Command]  
```
docker start 22146d15eb71
```

Run docker ps -l again to see the status change

[Output]  
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
22146d15eb71        alpine:3.4          "sh"                3 minutes ago       Exited (0) 2 minutes ago                      grave_leavitt
```

This command will start the container and exit right away we have not specified interactive mode in the command

## Creating Pretty Reports with Formatters  
The following command will print the output in a way that we desire

```
docker ps --format "{{.ID}}: {{.Status}}"
```

[Output]  
```
2533adf280ac: Up 12 minutes
```

## Stopping and Removing Containers  
We have learnt about interacting with a container, running a container, pausing and unpausing a container, creating and starting a container. But what if you want to stop the container or remove the container itself

### Stop a container  
A container can be stopped using **stop** command. This command will stop the application inside that container hence the container itself will be stopped. This command basically sends a **SIGTERM** signal to the container (graceful shutdown)

[Command]  
```
docker stop 2533adf280ac
```

[Output]  
```
2533adf280ac
